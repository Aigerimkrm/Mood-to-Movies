She daydreams about the outside world, but dares not travel from her home due to the warnings of the clan's chief.  One day the kingdom of Mezarte invades her homeland.

But their relationship sets in motion a course of events and revelations that will cause Estella to embrace her wicked side and become the raucous, fashionable and revenge-bent Cruella.",7.993,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/wToO8opxkGwKgSfJ1JK8tGvkG6U.jpg,"['https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/xO663aW9mBhrVtr1kwiNZ8xOCtx.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/LTOZB3N1kYA2Xu1lW114HFA1o8.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/nt21xmsQ8Jah6FJWE2MHGfyTJLg.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/f8sYAxcM3zRwe4P8cnjKFidq3Jh.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/zpRGksvSs4PjNQw1lGroVWYOzaM.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/8ChCpCYxh9YXusmHwcE9YzP0TSG.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/d5McQLrJTxgOyslU8sqJz2wJU6E.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/5nTutFfPWDN2rvEa79SKZ39vRZw.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/2101JmTA01Ox8oPVZeOeQ1Itmtb.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/ct6WDISgNTK6svgzhOfE3VklYu2.jpg']",<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2000x450 at 0x177F5A28B60>,"[(29, 29, 27), (218, 207, 193), (116, 94, 74), (143, 156, 151), (207, 29, 25), (123, 134, 148)]",0.021667147055268288,0.0370258092880249,0.08252792060375214,0.0834481343626976,0.05977105349302292,0.1263384222984314,0.056730784475803375,0.041687190532684326,0.04132331162691116,0.03562647104263306,0.07523144036531448,0.06249167397618294,0.07509534060955048,0.033140525221824646,0.025391731411218643,0.04290861636400223,0.02353023551404476,0.057362452149391174,0.018701773136854172,"[0.03314053 0.02353024 0.06249167 0.02539173 0.04132331 0.08344813

Unlike the Virtual Reality of the NerveGear and the Amusphere, it is perfectly safe and allows players to use it while they are conscious, creating an instant hit on the market. The most popular application for the Augma is the game Ordinal Scale, which immerses players in a fantasy role-playing game with player rankings and rewards.  Following the new craze, Kirito's friends dive into the game, and despite his reservations about the system, Kirito eventually joins them. While at first it appears to be just fun and games, they soon find out that the game is not all that it seems...",7.7,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/2szdEK0Mr0RG0nWGFVTseNQHbnP.jpg,"['https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/D6JoAoKsOlqCDgovoTS742hCH3.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/2lmRE7KGlKmuJ0i4MoOMxssqmeZ.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/tiRPuoZ1cSdkVnm9MaMxsxdj59E.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/prk5WsW0bupTUn7iY4Z36RIjBA3.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/zImJYbn11PwUosOuTf7Fqc80JN9.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/v4YjRe1NsjwcCPK7ZbxxtMVJ4qk.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/y9NQhlAw4YrAwGui4xkYYttd1kA.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/qgasW75FfHW7LJ739FqGJRDQKBw.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/yFZG86Zvdy6JuIlMW9eHxlVkct5.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/ndWcpdNq3rwGwX7dNXOwxIeEEmy.jpg']",<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2000x450 at 0x177F5C86BD0>,"[(226, 190, 153), (45, 36, 45), (155, 172, 186), (149, 103, 84), (104, 122, 181), (68, 89, 129)]",0.06688927114009857,0.10200098156929016,0.08451606333255768,0.06287670135498047,0.05535764619708061,0.05598563328385353,0.037854962050914764,0.04642457887530327,0.05079543963074684,0.0318625345826149,0.051685720682144165,0.023677600547671318,0.07452009618282318,0.0449470579624176,0.06588204950094223,0.06106782332062721,0.02779250219464302,0.029949447140097618,0.02591390162706375,"[0.04494706 0.0277925  0.0236776  0.06588205 0.05079544 0.0628767
