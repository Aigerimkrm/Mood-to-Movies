Jacques and Enzo are a pair of friends who have been close since childhood, and who share a passion for the dangerous sport of free diving. Professional diver Jacques opted to follow in the footsteps of his father, who died at sea when Jacques was a boy; to the bewilderment of scientists, Jacques harbors a remarkable ability to adjust his heart rate and breathing pattern in the water, so that his vital signs more closely resemble that of dolphins than men.  As Enzo persuades a reluctant Jacques to compete against him in a free diving contest -- determining who can dive deeper and longer without scuba gear -- Jacques meets Johana, a beautiful insurance investigator from America, and he finds that he must choose between his love for her and his love of the sea.",7.455,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/3t5t7yaFiTJQlqxiTkXJMFZdkh3.jpg,"['https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/v8mkYz9jdLCFBH524HWcayjOmtO.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/vivKtEJBPCKj2ffCUXTkUk31Vk2.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/nXnDaQcab5VZfIkachPcC4xOgwX.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/tXW7PXD4PJ2eG6jrdwxs9ie6wbL.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/yoCJMAN1jmazNwMWcW43G2QtyBN.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/vXnJ1efTZKXDjnY5eMae3lz9CS7.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/ed0SkD7qGZIKCWvsDT7kszVNmNE.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/zt5KmjDMJoPb8KDNBX0rst02527.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/3Jj0VKMlB7mBZEawTnNDtrCEFAB.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/kB2SEAd3kw7hHDBEOi8QhnSpzNR.jpg']",<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2000x450 at 0x7FD11C38CAD0>,"[(34, 80, 113), (205, 195, 183), (93, 196, 221), (48, 33, 23), (37, 139, 196), (66, 140, 160)]",0.19531066715717316,0.07816923409700394,0.052958548069000244,0.04310334101319313,0.055579643696546555,0.031163856387138367,0.05169733241200447,0.048345956951379776,0.04693404957652092,0.06661104410886765,0.02286851592361927,0.02804030291736126,0.0747060477733612,0.04899846389889717,0.022094590589404106,0.07050372660160065,0.014405248686671257,0.03787430748343468,0.010635134764015675,"[0.04899846 0.01440525 0.02286852 0.07050373 0.04693405 0.06661104

He is to build the palace and be covered in gold or, if not, his fate is to be eaten by crocodiles. Edifis calls upon an old friend to help him out: The fabulous Druid Getafix from Gaul, who brews a fantastic potion that gives supernatural strength. In order to help and protect the old Druid, Asterix and Obelix accompany him on his journey to Egypt.

Mona is fiercely independent, craving freedom over comfort, but it is this desire to be free that will eventually lead to her demise.",7.3,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/pHw4CHC389eWaUa83PZKOfv6OAt.jpg,"['https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/dsdw2dGnqv59onfnqd9CJw1mLK.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/9VL6xeUtrQxDZeDYMQY0gOXGukb.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/tjFilF6lySyS4tKXuBYLFUeWKOC.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/t2Da5fxbfIKrtr1E0EGBt99hQ8Z.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/grmNmfeCBzuS6QrDlxuoVBptHZN.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/vpP4cAS5Iv9P5qJXTR3UXoPvoXM.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/Ae9EfZSHKSinnCzrDP4sFNeQWNG.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/pLhckFk3U4y15PUX73a1LFLFjKL.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/p341v48mBoPJnqS6apoNYqYDmhh.jpg', 'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w1280/4JRuhh4BUVHqnmT5mvhGbLQ62En.jpg']",<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2000x450 at 0x7FD1173CD3D0>,"[(46, 50, 47), (196, 171, 143), (127, 106, 89), (146, 160, 157), (87, 114, 112), (127, 145, 158)]",0.045736487954854965,0.0719396248459816,0.04839039966464043,0.04161466285586357,0.05282362177968025,0.03139050304889679,0.045228030532598495,0.04055975005030632,0.05181581526994705,0.07439867407083511,0.055906299501657486,0.05634882301092148,0.0853433832526207,0.027178138494491577,0.08327333629131317,0.05699143186211586,0.08010318130254745,0.024309150874614716,0.02664860710501671,"[0.02717814 0.08010318 0.0559063  0.05699143 0.05181582 0.07439867
